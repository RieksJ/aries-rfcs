# [Term](#_Term): Definition (of a Term)


##  [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) 

 Description that precisely specifies the meaning of a term (i.e. a word or word group). 

##  [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) 

 The combination of at least:<br><ol><li>the term (word or word group) that is being defined</li><li>a scope of applicability (i.e. where the definition is to be used);<br>(c) a short, non-authoritative description that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term, and that can be used to replace the term ‘in situ’ (i.e. wherever it is used);<br>(d) one or more examples to give readers a rough idea about what instances of the term may look like;<br>(e) a statement that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) allows users to determine (within the scope of applicability) whether or not something is an instance of the term, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) is formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two users determine differently in the same case, is minimized;<br>(f) a description of the relevance of having the definition (why it is needed).

##  [Relevance](#Relevance) 

 In normal situations, terms can be defined colloquially without leading to misunderstandings. However, there are situations where its meaning must be defined in a (more) precise way. Typical examples of such situations are where IT is being developed, or when a good understanding of something is needed. Therefore, we need a means to maximize a first understanding of a term, and minimize the likelihood of misunderstandings occurring, or going undetected. 

| [Properties](#Properties) | Definitions are scoped, i.e. have a limited applicability. They should only be used in the scope(s) where they are considered applicable.

Criteria may be a composition of several (more or less formal logic) statements, interconnected with operations such as AND, OR, etc.

##  [Pitfalls](#Pitfalls) 

 People tend to ignore the fact that the meaning of terms is scoped, i.e. that in different situations the term still means the same thing (or should mean the same thing). Such (often tacit) assumptions cause lots of discussions about the term, which is basically wasted energy.

| [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous) | The quality of the criteria determines the usefulness of the definition.

Criteria (should) have a track record, i.e. a list of use-cases in which it has effectively been applied. Such use-cases would then also serve as examples for users.

[[Term]](#Term) The word or phrase that is being defined. If the defined word depends on other concepts, make this a phrase that includes such concepts, as in: Identity (of an Entity).

[[Colloquial Definition]](#ColloquialDefinition) a non-authoritative description of the term that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term.

[[Formal Definition]](#FormalDefinition) provide a statement (as formal as possible) that allows readers to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term, formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two readers (that belong to the intended audience of this document) conclude differently in the same case, is minimized.

[[Example(s)]](#Examples) give one or two examples of the term/phrase that readers can think about when reading the other definition texts so as to help them understand it.

[[Relevance]](#Relevance) describe the relevance of having the definition, thus providing purpose to having it.

[[Properties]](#Properties) further elaboration of the term, listing properties that an instance of the term must, should, or may have, and that are important for a reader to be aware of.

[[Specializations]](#Specializations) (optional) field, where you can identify any other term that is a specializatios of the defined term, and provide criteria that allows the user to determine whether or not something that qualifies as an instance of the term also qualifies as such a specialization.

[[Pitfalls]](#Pitfalls) identify pitfalls that users have been known to fall into when applying the term (within its scope), implicitly warning the users to avoid that.

[[Related terminology]](#Related) mention relations that this term may have with terms that readers might (commonly) use in other contexts, such as, for example, W3C contexts.

[[Standards]](#Standards) reference(s) to standards documents that define the term in sufficiently the same way. Standards that define the term in a different way may be listed under ‘Pitfalls’.

[[Miscellaneous]](#Miscellaneous1) any other texts that may be relevant for most readers.
