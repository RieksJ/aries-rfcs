# [Term](#_Term): Entity


##  [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) 

 something that is known to exist. 

##  [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) 

 something that is known to exist by at least one Party. 

##  [Example(s)](#Examples) 

 People, organizations, things, resources, but also ideas, concepts, etc. (which reside in the mind(s) of someone).

##  [Relevance](#Relevance) 

 the ability to refer to something that exists without knowing anything else is necessary to define and use e.g. identifiers and identities. Also, this ability allows us to define basic terms as a specialization of something that has no other property than that it is known to exist. 

##  [Properties](#Properties) 

 Something of which nobody knows that it exists is not an entity, because nobody would or could (or need to) refer to it, and nobody ever has referred to it. 

##  [Specializations](#Specializations) 

 **Subject**: Entity to which a Claim applies. See the definition of Claim for details.

**Party**: Entity that has knowledge about what exists, the ability to reason with this knowledge, and make decisions. See its definition for details.

**Actor**: Entity that is capable of acting (doing something). See its definition for details.

##  [Pitfalls](#Pitfalls) 

 The term ‘entity’ is sometimes used where more precise terms are more appropriate. For example, in [NIST] the term ‘Custodian’ is defined as “an Entity acting on behalf of another Entity …”. This suggests that Custodians are Actors (as they can act), which is not necessarily what is meant. Also, it suggests that acting can be done on behalf of any other Entity, e.g. a coffee cup. 

##  [Related terminology](#Related) 

 Words that colloquially have a similar meaning, such as `things` may be used. However, this term has a specific and different meaning in the context of IoT. 

##  [Standards](#Standards) 

 IETF RFC 3986, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) uses the term `Resource` for this. [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entity): something that has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality. [Oxford (Lexico)](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/entity) A thing with distinct and independent existence.

##  [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous) 

 Only after something has become known can we make statements about it (that we may store, process or exchange with one another).

[[Term]](#Term) The word or phrase that is being defined. If the defined word depends on other concepts, make this a phrase that includes such concepts, as in: Identity (of an Entity).

[[Colloquial Definition]](#ColloquialDefinition) a non-authoritative description of the term that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term.

[[Formal Definition]](#FormalDefinition) provide a statement (as formal as possible) that allows readers to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term, formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two readers (that belong to the intended audience of this document) conclude differently in the same case, is minimized.

[[Example(s)]](#Examples) give one or two examples of the term/phrase that readers can think about when reading the other definition texts so as to help them understand it.

[[Relevance]](#Relevance) describe the relevance of having the definition, thus providing purpose to having it.

[[Properties]](#Properties) further elaboration of the term, listing properties that an instance of the term must, should, or may have, and that are important for a reader to be aware of.

[[Specializations]](#Specializations) (optional) field, where you can identify any other term that is a specializatios of the defined term, and provide criteria that allows the user to determine whether or not something that qualifies as an instance of the term also qualifies as such a specialization.

[[Pitfalls]](#Pitfalls) identify pitfalls that users have been known to fall into when applying the term (within its scope), implicitly warning the users to avoid that.

[[Related terminology]](#Related) mention relations that this term may have with terms that readers might (commonly) use in other contexts, such as, for example, W3C contexts.

[[Standards]](#Standards) reference(s) to standards documents that define the term in sufficiently the same way. Standards that define the term in a different way may be listed under ‘Pitfalls’.

[[Miscellaneous]](#Miscellaneous1) any other texts that may be relevant for most readers.
