[[Colloquial Definition]](#ColloquialDefinition) a non-authoritative description of the term that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term.

[[Formal Definition]](#FormalDefinition) provide a statement (as formal as possible) that allows readers to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term, formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two readers (that belong to the intended audience of this document) conclude differently in the same case, is minimized.

[[Example(s)]](#Examples) give one or two examples of the term/phrase that readers can think about when reading the other definition texts so as to help them understand it.

[[Relevance]](#Relevance) describe the relevance of having the definition, thus providing purpose to having it.

[[Properties]](#Properties) further elaboration of the term, listing properties that an instance of the term must, should, or may have, and that are important for a reader to be aware of.

[[Specializations]](#Specializations) (optional) field, where you can identify any other term that is a specializatios of the defined term, and provide criteria that allows the user to determine whether or not something that qualifies as an instance of the term also qualifies as such a specialization.

[[Pitfalls]](#Pitfalls) identify pitfalls that users have been known to fall into when applying the term (within its scope), implicitly warning the users to avoid that.

[[Related terminology]](#Related) mention relations that this term may have with terms that readers might (commonly) use in other contexts, such as, for example, W3C contexts.

[[Standards]](#Standards) reference(s) to standards documents that define the term in sufficiently the same way. Standards that define the term in a different way may be listed under ‘Pitfalls’.
