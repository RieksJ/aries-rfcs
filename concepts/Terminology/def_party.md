# [Term](#_Term): Party


##  [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) 

 Entity that has knowledge about what exists, and the ability to maintain and use this knowledge. 

##  [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) 

 Entity that is the sovereign regarding some knowledge about (a subset of) what exists (which includes its "self"), and has the ability to maintain and use this knowledge, e.g. by observing, communicating, reasoning and decision making. 

##  [Example(s)](#Examples) 

 People (natural persons) organizations, enterprises, (legal persons) 

##  [Relevance](#Relevance) 

 We need the ability to distinguish between entities that are sovereings over some knowledge and those that are not, because the first decide about the meaning of words they use, they make the decisions whom (not) to trust, when (not) to engage in business transactions, etc. Entities that are not sovereign over some knowledge may still make decisions and decide when (not) to engage in transactions, but they would then do so *on behalf* of an entity that is such a sovereign. Consequently, entities that are such sovereigns may be held accountable whereas others would not. 

##  [Properties](#Properties) 

 Parties can act in a self-sovereign way, whereas entities that are not Parties cannot.

Parties can conduct (business) transactions with each other as they please, whereas entities that are not Parties can only participate in (parts of) such transactions on behalf of a Party (i.e. as an Agent). 

| [Specializations](#Specializations) | **Natural Person**: a body of flesh and blood.

**Organization**: a (non-empty) group of Actors that work together to realize a (non-empty) set of objectives (the primary objective often called the Mission of the Organization). Note that corporations and governments qualify as Organizations under this criterion, as do departments, business-units, etc.

**Legal Person (in a Jurisdiction)**: a Party that qualifies as such according to the criteria (laws) of that Jurisdiction.

**Mandator**: a Party that has provided a Mandate to an Actor. See the definition of ‘Mandate’ for details

##  [Pitfalls](#Pitfalls) 

 Some Parties cannot act. Examples are organizations, governments. They need actors (people, or machines) to act on their behalf. Other Parties can act, e.g. people.

Entities that are not parties cannot be held accountable/responsible (for their actions), because they have no awareness/knowledge.

There are no requirements regarding the kinds of knowledge a Party must or should (not) have. So, it is ok if a Party decides that the earth is flat, that we never set foot on the moon, or that SSI is not going to make it. Similarly, there are no requirements regarding the logic that a Party must or should (not) use. Any kind of (business) logic is ok.

 In common parlance the following words may be Parties: Person, human being, organization, corporation, business unit, government (body), natural person, legal person.

At RwOT 9 (Prague) the following definition of "Self" was pasted on the wall: "a subjective perception of where one's agency ends and another's agency begins, where consciousness emerges and persists, is abe to sense, perceive, interact, decide and act. It was also related to the term "[Qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).

The [Oxford dictionary (Lexico)](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/party) has several definitions, some of which come close, e.g. "A person or people forming one side in an agreement or dispute." [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/party) has e.g. "a person or group taking one side of a question, dispute, or contest", which emphasises the sovereignty of a party (albeit in a bit different way than we do)

 As AI components are becoming more intelligent, it might happen that at some point in time we should say that they become sovereign over the data/information they hold, and satisfy the criteria for being a Party (and we should then also be discussing about any accountability such components may be assigned). For now, we do not consder AI to be a Party
