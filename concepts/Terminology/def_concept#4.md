| [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) | |
| [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) | An app (mobile, web, or native) that people or orgs use to manage secrets, including payment and identity info. |

| [Related terminology](#Related) | This concept is currently called `wallet` by many in identity circles; Indy developers would call it `an app that has a wallet`. An important nuance is that apps can be multitenant (multiple Netflix users or XBox gamers in a single household; multiple Fitbit profiles on a single tablet), which makes this concept slightly misaligned with [Concept#3 Indy “wallet”].|

[[Colloquial Definition]](#ColloquialDefinition) a non-authoritative description of the term that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term.

[[Formal Definition]](#FormalDefinition) provide a statement (as formal as possible) that allows readers to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term, formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two readers (that belong to the intended audience of this document) conclude differently in the same case, is minimized.

[[Example(s)]](#Examples) give one or two examples of the term/phrase that readers can think about when reading the other definition texts so as to help them understand it.

[[Specializations]](#Specializations) (optional) field, where you can identify any other term that is a specializatios of the defined term, and provide criteria that allows the user to determine whether or not something that qualifies as an instance of the term also qualifies as such a specialization.
