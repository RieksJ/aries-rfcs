# [Term](#_Term): Concept#2

| [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) | |
| [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) | A service that has delegated authority in the form of keys to act as a fiduciary for exactly one specific [concept #8 “self”] in DIDComm-based interactions. |

| [Related terminology](#Related) | Indy calls this `agent`, nodding to phrases like “talent agent” and “real estate agent.” It is somewhat similar to the idea of `user agent` from browser terminology, but browser user agents often lack delegated keys and do not support DIDComm. This is what DIF would designate as a user’s Wallet App/Mobile Agent or an organization’s Enterprise Agent, which may have a CLI or dashboard interface. |

[[Term]](#Term) The word or phrase that is being defined. If the defined word depends on other concepts, make this a phrase that includes such concepts, as in: Identity (of an Entity).

[[Colloquial Definition]](#ColloquialDefinition) a non-authoritative description of the term that provides the casual reader with a rough idea about the meaning of the term.

[[Formal Definition]](#FormalDefinition) provide a statement (as formal as possible) that allows readers to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term, formulated in such a way that the likelihood that any two readers (that belong to the intended audience of this document) conclude differently in the same case, is minimized.

[[Example(s)]](#Examples) give one or two examples of the term/phrase that readers can think about when reading the other definition texts so as to help them understand it.

[[Relevance]](#Relevance) describe the relevance of having the definition, thus providing purpose to having it.

[[Properties]](#Properties) further elaboration of the term, listing properties that an instance of the term must, should, or may have, and that are important for a reader to be aware of.

[[Specializations]](#Specializations) (optional) field, where you can identify any other term that is a specializatios of the defined term, and provide criteria that allows the user to determine whether or not something that qualifies as an instance of the term also qualifies as such a specialization.

[[Pitfalls]](#Pitfalls) identify pitfalls that users have been known to fall into when applying the term (within its scope), implicitly warning the users to avoid that.

[[Related terminology]](#Related) mention relations that this term may have with terms that readers might (commonly) use in other contexts, such as, for example, W3C contexts.

[[Standards]](#Standards) reference(s) to standards documents that define the term in sufficiently the same way. Standards that define the term in a different way may be listed under ‘Pitfalls’.

[[Miscellaneous]](#Miscellaneous1) any other texts that may be relevant for most readers.
