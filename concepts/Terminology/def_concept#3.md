# [Term](#_Term): Concept#3

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [Colloquial Definition](#ColloquialDefinition) | |
| [Formal Definition](#FormalDefinition) | A specialized container that provides crypto-based security guarantees, making it a safe repository for keys and other sensitive info. |

| [Properties](#Properties) | |
| [Specializations](#Specializations) | |
| [Pitfalls](#Pitfalls) | |
| [Related terminology](#Related) | This concept is currently called identity wallet or just wallet by Indy developers due to HIPE 0013. Its meaning is close to that of `key chain` as used by platform vendors, except that it encompasses other sensitive info as well. |
| [Standards](#Standards) | |
| [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous) |  Many in the community lack a term for this except for the informal phrase `wallet storage`; they apply the term `wallet` to [`concept#4 industry “wallet”`] instead. I wonder if we ought to rename this? Would be painful, given the amount of code that exists… (must manage keys/addresses/payment, DID relationships/contexts, and cred generation - maybe DID Manager, Secret Manager?) |
